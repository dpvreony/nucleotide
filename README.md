# Nucleotide

![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/jk9v57hxjj0mi6t4?svg=true)

## Introduction

Nucleotide is a library to aid in the T4 generation of code for manipulation of POCO objects.

This project came about from wanting to leverage the power of T4 whilst giving a simple way of keeping the code generation in an easy to use place.  I welcome feedback on the project including suggestions on improvement, additions, or alternative methods.
